The Coursera Exercise for Machine Learning
For online course, I chose the classic course of machine learning, which was popular on Coursera a few years ago, and was taught by Professor Andrew Ng. There will be 11 weeks of courses (about 60 hours), and there will be one quiz or programming exercise every week (about 40 hours). 

The homework are implemented by Matlab or Octave. Since this course overlaps with Big Data and Data Mining(INT402) in the first semester, I decided to use Python /Jupyter Notebook to complete the related programming homework.
